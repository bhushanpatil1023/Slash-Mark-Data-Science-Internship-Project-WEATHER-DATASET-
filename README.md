The provided file is a data science project focused on weather analysis. It involves loading weather data, performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature selection, model building, and evaluating model performance. The project uses Python libraries like pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, and scikit-learn for data manipulation, visualization, and machine learning tasks. The dataset includes various weather parameters like temperature, rainfall, wind speed, humidity, pressure, and more. Key steps in the project include loading the data, understanding its structure, handling missing values, calculating statistical measures like mean, median, and mode for different weather variables, and preparing the data for model training and testing.
